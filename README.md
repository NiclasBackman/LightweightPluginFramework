# LightweightPluginFramework
A C++ lightweight framework for plugins. Define your plugin interface and this framework will be your friend. The framework loads the pre-defined plugins and exposes their interface to user application. This is a "header file only" solution and no need of external libraries etc.

Restrictions:
Currently only support for Linux or similar system.
